# InterviewQuestions

A place to put interview questions I have been asked.
Coding on a white board or a piece of paper is completely unnatural.
The solutions in this repository are how I actually code.

Assessing a programmer with a paper or whiteboard exercise is like
assessing a person's table manners after giving them a straw to
use to eat a meal.  The exercise is not entirely without merit but
it is insane and silly.
